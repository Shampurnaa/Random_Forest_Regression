# Random Forest Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook template for performing random forest regression, a powerful ensemble learning method for regression tasks. The notebook provides a detailed guide on training and visualizing a random forest regression model using a dataset of position levels and salaries.

## Notebook

### Random_Forest_Regression.ipynb

This notebook covers:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Training the Random Forest Regression model on the whole dataset
- Predicting new results
- Visualizing the Random Forest Regression results with higher resolution

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-forest-regression.git
    ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
    - You can open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
